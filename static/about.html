        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>
            • To address above problem, we propose a machine learning (ML) project focused on detecting driver drowsiness in real-time. The project aims to develop a system that can accurately recognize signs of drowsiness based on various indicators, such as facial expressions, eye movements, and physiological signals. <br>

            • The ML model will be trained using a large dataset consisting of images and sensor data collected from drivers under different drowsiness levels. Facial recognition algorithms will extract features related to eye closure, head position, and facial muscle movements. Additionally, sensors like electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate monitors will provide physiological signals to capture brain activity and heart rate variability, respectively. <br>

            • The collected data will be preprocessed to extract relevant features and normalize them for training the ML model. Several classification algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), or deep learning models, will be evaluated to identify the best approach for driver drowsiness detection.<br>

            • During the testing phase, the trained model will be integrated into a real-time 
            monitoring system that continuously analyzes incoming data from cameras and 
            sensors installed in vehicles. If drowsiness is detected, appropriate alerts will be generated, such as audio alarms, visual warnings, or haptic feedback, to notify the driver and prompt them to take corrective action.<br>

            • The performance of the system will be evaluated using various metrics, including 
            accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, by comparing the predictions made by the ML model with ground truth data. The project's success will be measured by 
            achieving high accuracy rates and minimizing false positives and false negatives in drowsiness detection.<br>

            • In conclusion, this ML project aims to develop an effective system for real-time driver drowsiness detection, employing facial recognition and physiological signal analysis. By alerting drowsy drivers promptly, the system can help prevent accidents and save 
            lives on the road.
